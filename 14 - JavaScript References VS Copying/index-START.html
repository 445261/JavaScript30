    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    age = 200;
    //  console.log(age, age2);
    
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    //console.log(players, team);
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'hee haw';
    console.log(team4);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;
    console.log(captain);
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(captain);
    console.log(cap2);
    
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3);
    

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name = 'wesley';
    console.log(dev);
    dev.social.twitter = '@webbossman';
    console.log(dev);
    console.log(wes); //Object.assign only copies one level down, social is referenced instead of copied because it is nested 
    //so when dev.social was modified, original wes.social got changed as well
    //must use something like cloneDeep function
    
    //can use poor mans deepclone, but do not use this: stringify obj then convert string to obj
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    console.log(dev2);
